<p>
Musician, developer, with a Master of Engineering in signal processing and electronics 
from <a href="http://www.ensea.fr">l'Ecole Nationale Superieur de l'Electronique et de ses Applications (ENSEA)</a> 
in Paris, France. I have worked for companies such as  <a href="http://www.voxler.fr/">Voxler Games</a> and <a href="http://www.arkamys.com/home.php">Arkamys</a>, but also at
<a href="http://www.ircam.fr/"">L'Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM)</a> in Paris, France. 
</p>

<p>
I am currently making synthesizers at <a href="http://www.davesmithinstruments.com">Dave Smith Instruments</a>. 
</p>

<p>
My music is largely based on improvisation, incorporating multiple facets of electroacoustic
music such as digital and analogue electronic experimentation, collage, tape music, field 
recordings and the use of recorded music as a raw material. For this purpose, I design 
hardware and software tools. I also create automatic compositions based on algorithms that 
simulate guided random walks. While my work is undeniably artistically-motivated, my process 
is nevertheless influenced by, and in some instances, dependent on my 
technical and scientific foundations.
